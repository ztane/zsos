2006-08-23: Ilja Everila <saarni@kapsi.fi>
	- Renamed headers under kernel/ to *.hh. It's nicer for editors

2006-03-15: (Ilja) moved rudimentary kmalloc code from libc to
	kernel/mm, since that's what it is: part of the kernel's
	memory management.

2005-12-21: (Antti) Multitasking sorta works :P Legendary proof of
	concept with A's and B's...

2005-05-27:
	(Antti) Loads of changes. The kernel now has paging (hooray),
	it resets paging and gdt using new fancy files. Added symbol
	END_OF_BOOTLOADER to boot.S so that the temp memory can be freed 
	later! vsnprintf has now paddings - both space and 0 are usable
	(0 is even allowed for strings... phew...).

2005-01-09:
	(Ilja) Started recoding the multiboot structure in C++. Added
	a new class MultibootInfo, which is used to get multiboot data
	from the passed structure. It still needs some work, but the
	basics work fine. Created multiboot.cc for code.

	(Ilja) snprintf now supports the operator '%u' for unsigned
	ints (properly). Also ostream kout in iostream has support
	for unsigned ints.

2005-01-08:
	(Antti) CPU traps and interrupts seem to work fine.
	All PIC related code has been moved to pic.cc and should 
	stay there. A new class was written - InterruptDescriptor,
	which wraps an IDT entry and provides methods for querying
	and setting all the related values as well as handy constructors
	suitable for static initializers (as we have done in interrupt.cc)

2005-01-07:
	(Antti) Asm wrappers for interrupts 0x00-0x2F and some
	stubs in interrupts.cc.

2005-01-06:
	(Antti) make install, that copies the newly built 
	kernel image to the root of first partition on 
	the loop image.

	(Ilja) Kernel binary is now in elf32-i386 format with load
	address of 0x100000. The kernel is also in multiboot format
	and it accepts the multiboot data structure as a parameter.

	(Antti) The kernel is now ready for stuff in C++. Static 
	initializers (constructors for global objects) and new / 
	delete all work now.

	(Antti) (in|out)[bwl], far(poke|peek)[bwl], io_wait and
	unlock_irq inline functions added. interrupt.cc now contains 
	init_pic and remap_pic(int, int), for remapping	the PIC to
	different interrupt vectors.

	(Antti) Keyboard and timer interrupts seems to work
	now, although the code currently seems invariably triple
	fault at certain point...

2005-01-05:
	(Antti) createimage tool introduced (creates 50 meg
	disk image, partition table, one partition in vfat
	format, activated. Also make mount and make umount
	to mount this loop image to mnt subdirectory. A stripped
	down boot floppy with grub in img/grubfloppy.img.gz,
	that is to be uncompressed to img/grubfloppy.img.

2004-12-28:
	(Antti) Finally imported the wchar.h :d

2004-12-27:
	(Antti) Wide char versions of intostr and uintostr
	(called intowstr and uintowcs) and their shortcuts (called
	intowcs/intoxwcs and uintowcs/uintoxwcs respectively...)

2004-12-21:
	(Ilja) Malloc now contains kcalloc and krealloc
	functions.

2004-12-12:
	(Ilja) Functions for allocating memory added and
	modified to use better algorithms.

	(Antti) Functions for setting and getting the
	values of gdt descriptors.

	(Antti) Makefiles now with -nostdinc

	(Antti) ChangeLog founded
